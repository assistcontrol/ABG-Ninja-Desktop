# ABG-Ninja-Desktop
ABG Ninja on your desktop!

This is an experiment to use existing tooling to wrap
[ABG Ninja](https://abg.ninja) as an executable. I have
the general process working fine from my local machines,
but Github Actions and build artifacts are mysterious
beasts that I haven't learned to slay yet.

In other words, there's nothing actually here ðŸ˜Ÿ
